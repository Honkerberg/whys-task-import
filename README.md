## Task from Whys company

According to all tasks I made, here are the steps how to run this little project:

- On Linux/Mac machine, create folder `.venv` to install virtual environment
- Install virtual environment with installation of `requirements.txt`, or use `pipenv install` if you use it.
- After installation, activate virtual environment and navigate to folder `whys-imports` - There is whole core of this task
- Don't forget to migrate and create superuser!

- Start Django server with command `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

### Endpoints
With running Django server, go to URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, endpoint with import will show up.
    If you navigate to URL `"http://127.0.0.1:8000/details/"`, you will see all GET endpoints.
